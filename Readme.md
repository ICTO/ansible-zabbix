## Description

*ansible-zabbix* is an [Ansible](http://ansible.cc) playbook.
The playbook contains tasks to install Zabbix server (with MySQL backend), the PHP frontend and Zabbix agent.

## Requirements

### Ansible

Everything is documented on the [Ansible](http://ansible.cc/docs/gettingstarted.html) site...

### Supported platforms

Playbook tested on *Debian-7.0-b4-amd64*, probably works on other Debian versions too. Heavily depends on *apt*, sorry CentOS users...

## Usage

### Get the code

```bash
$ git clone git@github.ugent.be:tberton/ansible-zabbix.git
```

### Create a host file

Following example make ansible aware of the Vagrant box reachable on localhost port 2222.

```bash
$ vi ansible.host
```

with

```
[vagrant]
127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port=2222
```

### Create host specific variables

Make the host_vars directory where *ansible.host* file is located.

```bash
$ mkdir host_vars
```

Create a file in the newly created directory matching your host.

```bash
$ cd host_vars
$ vi 127.0.0.1
```

with

```
---
with_agent: true
with_server: true
with_web: true
```

### Run the playbook

Use *ansible.host* as inventory. Run the playbook only for the remote host *vagrant*. Use *vagrant* as the SSH user to connect to the remote host. *-k* enables the SSH password prompt.

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -k -i ansible.host ansible-zabbix/setup.yml --extra-vars="hosts=vagrant user=vagrant"
```
